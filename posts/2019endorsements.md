# Seattle Times vs. The Stranger: An Election Endorsements Scorecard

# 2019/07/27

It's primary season in Seattle, which means two things: 1) becoming unreasonably invested in the stocks of candidates in city council districts other than your own, in some cruel grass-is-greener logic, and 2) paying all too little attention to several races that you do get to vote on, and then consulting The Stranger's voting guide in a panic out of a hope that their often oddly-justified leanings can fill in the blanks. From idle chats with friends, I know I'm not alone in this.

How common is this? Hard to say - the effect of an endorsement is pretty ambiguous without some way to test it against a control. A [2015 Crosscut article](https://crosscut.com/2015/10/times-or-stranger-whose-endorsement-drives-votes) looks in a few directions, like Google search frequency, and doesn't unearth any solid answers, although the qualitative evidence certainly points in the suggestion of a solid degree of influence.
