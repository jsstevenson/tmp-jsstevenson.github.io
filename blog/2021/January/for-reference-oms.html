</div>
<div><div class="card-body"><p>Having received a few questions about this, I'm posting these here to ensure that they aren't lost forever when I forget to pay my Dropbox bill and they nuke my cluttered personal folders forever. They're a little cringe-inducing (I think personal statements always are), but hopefully someone finds them useful.</p>
<p>I'll note also that I wrote close to the maximum permitted length - since submitting, I've reflected that this might not be advisable for others, or indeed for anyone. The admissions committee seems to be extremely permissive and simply wants to see some indication that you possess the minimum qualifications to succeed in the program. You don't need to write 2000 words to get there.</p>
<h2>Personal Statement</h2>
<p>When computer science caught me, I was a twenty-something college graduate searching for a distinctive angle into doctoral research in rhetoric. It was 2015, and the news media was buzzing from the effects that ‘social media algorithms’ were having on public news consumption, which seemed like an interesting starting place for me. To build the technical foundation for my upcoming research and see what these algorithms were really about, I began familiarizing myself with introductory coding in Python. Two weeks after seeing my first “Hello, World” printed to a console, my rhetoric books lay untouched, but my terminal saw daily activity. I felt my life changing directions.</p>
<p>Wanting to advance my technical background, I enrolled in post-baccalaureate coursework at my local community college and, eventually, at the University of Washington. I‘ve taken away valuable insights from all of my classes, but my favorites have focused on computational approaches to linear algebra and vector geometry, and their applications in statistical machine learning in particular. The mental labor involved in arranging and unfolding vectors and matrices to create clarity among a mess of apparently noisy data feels more like creating art than rearranging equations. Today, I am seeking graduate education in computer science to expand my technical skills and cultivate the creativity that work with machine learning algorithms inspires in me. I want to put that creativity to work writing better analytical software to find meaning in complex sets of public health and health science research data.</p>
<p>I am an unyielding believer in the power of clinical medicine. As an operations specialist with the University of Washington School of Medicine, I provide analytical and project management services in support of basic sciences education for future physicians. I see the need for novel computational techniques in understanding epidemiologic and genetic phenomena, two areas of patient care my current work frequently involves. I aim to work more closely with researchers to provide these types of software solutions to augment their investigations and open new avenues for treating patients.</p>
<p>Georgia Tech’s Online Master of Science in Computer Science program is an ideal educational environment for me. I am especially interested in pursuing the Machine Learning specialization, not only to build upon my existing coursework in linear algebra, statistics, and algorithm theory, but also to get practice handling large datasets in an applied setting in courses like Big Data Systems &amp; Analysis. The health and bioinformatics courses offered by GT would help me gain hands-on experience and knowledge of industry-specific protocols like Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources and to get training on large-scale data technologies handling the problems in healthcare that I find most intriguing.</p>
<p>As a working professional, OMSCS would add breadth and depth to my existing education on a schedule that allows me continue to support my family at home. The rigorous training I would receive within a prestigious institution like Georgia Tech would be invaluable to my pursuit of work at the crossroads of computer science, health sciences, and bioinformatics.</p>
<h2>Background Statement</h2>
<p>As a prospective graduate student from a nontechnical background, I began post-baccalaureate studies in computer science to catch up to my peers’ credentials and to mature my own study skills. Finding success at Seattle Central College, I chose to transfer to the University of Washington, expecting the competition and rigor to better approximate the challenges of graduate-level courses. Staying ahead on homework while maintaining full-time employment hasn’t been easy - and has been instructive for finding my own limits - but the challenge has pushed me to make significant improvements upon my undergraduate study habits.</p>
<p>Each of my classes has felt eminently valuable, but my favorites have been upper-division offerings in scientific computing. Seemingly abstract concepts like matrix decomposition and combinatorics become meaningful and significant when enmeshed in problems of systems biology or clinical research. This applied setting has been formative for the kinds of work that I want to pursue in my career.</p>
<p>I should not downplay the continued relevance of my previous education. Formal logic was a core element of my philosophy major; my classes emphasized proof technique and ingrained an intuition for abstraction and logic-testing that I continue to rely on in software development. Many of my favorite philosophers, from Bertrand Russell to Gilles Deleuze, drew from branches of mathematics like calculus and set theory that I have newfound uses for in computer science. My experience in competitive debate helped to hone my auto-didactic skills, filling in where my CS background is scarce. In debate, unfamiliarity with an opponent’s argument is never an excuse; confronting and mastering new and unknown corners of academia, from climate science and macroeconomics to moral theory and immigration law, is a must. The intellectual curiosity it instilled in me is a driving force behind my current efforts in switching careers.</p></div></div>
